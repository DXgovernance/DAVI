# How to contribute

There are many ways you can contribute to the dxdao governance dapp:

## Submitting changes

To submit a change you will need to create a [pull request template](https://github.com/DXgovernance/DAVI/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md) and fill all the necessary sections in the pull request description.

Always write a clear log message for your commits, one-line messages are fine for small changes, try to keep pull requests small and fix one issue at the time, please try to avoid huge commits.
